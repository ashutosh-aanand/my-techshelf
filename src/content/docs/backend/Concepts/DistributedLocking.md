## What is Distributed Locking?

Distributed locking is a mechanism used in distributed systems to prevent multiple processes or services from simultaneously accessing and modifying shared resources. It ensures data consistency and prevents race conditions in distributed environments where multiple instances of an application might be running.

## Why Do We Need Distributed Locking?

1. **Prevent Race Conditions**: When multiple services try to modify the same resource simultaneously
2. **Data Consistency**: Ensure data integrity across distributed systems
3. **Resource Management**: Control access to limited resources
4. **Coordination**: Synchronize operations across different services

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Database-Based Locking (MySQL)
```java
@Service
public class DistributedLockService {
    
    @Autowired
    private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;
    
    @Value("${lock.timeout.seconds:300}")
    private int lockTimeoutSeconds;
    
    public boolean acquireLock(String lockKey) {
        try {
            String sql = """
                INSERT INTO distributed_locks (lock_key, lock_time, timeout_seconds)
                VALUES (?, NOW(), ?)
                ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
                    lock_time = IF(
                        TIME_TO_SEC(TIMEDIFF(NOW(), lock_time)) > timeout_seconds,
                        NOW(),
                        lock_time
                    )
                """;
            
            int updated = jdbcTemplate.update(sql, lockKey, lockTimeoutSeconds);
            return updated > 0;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    public void releaseLock(String lockKey) {
        String sql = "DELETE FROM distributed_locks WHERE lock_key = ?";
        jdbcTemplate.update(sql, lockKey);
    }
}
```

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE distributed_locks (
    lock_key VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    lock_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    timeout_seconds INT NOT NULL,
    INDEX idx_lock_time (lock_time)
);
```

## Usage Example

```java
@Service
public class PaymentService {
    
    @Autowired
    private DistributedLockService lockService;
    
    @Transactional
    public void processPayment(String orderId) {
        String lockKey = "payment_" + orderId;
        
        try {
            if (!lockService.acquireLock(lockKey)) {
                throw new RuntimeException("Could not acquire lock for order: " + orderId);
            }
            
            // Process payment logic here
            performPaymentProcessing(orderId);
            
        } finally {
            lockService.releaseLock(lockKey);
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Lock Timeout**
   - Always implement a timeout mechanism
   - Choose appropriate timeout values based on operation duration
   - Handle timeout scenarios gracefully

2. **Lock Granularity**
   - Use specific lock keys for different resources
   - Avoid using too broad or too narrow lock scopes
   - Consider the trade-off between contention and complexity

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper exception handling
   - Always release locks in finally blocks
   - Handle network issues and database connectivity problems

4. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Monitor lock acquisition patterns
   - Clean up stale locks periodically
   - Log lock-related operations for debugging

## Alternative Implementations

1. **Redis-based Locking**
   - Using SETNX command
   - Better performance for high-concurrency scenarios
   - Requires Redis infrastructure

2. **Zookeeper**
   - Built-in distributed synchronization
   - More complex setup
   - Better for cluster coordination

3. **Hazelcast**
   - In-memory distributed locking
   - Good for cloud environments
   - Integrated with Spring Boot

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Dead Locks**
   - Not implementing proper timeout mechanisms
   - Not releasing locks in error scenarios
   - Acquiring multiple locks in different orders

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Too many lock acquisitions
   - Long lock holding times
   - Inappropriate lock granularity

3. **Race Conditions**
   - Not handling lock acquisition failures
   - Incorrect timeout calculations
   - Not considering clock synchronization

## Monitoring and Debugging

```sql
-- Query to find active locks
SELECT * FROM distributed_locks WHERE 
    TIME_TO_SEC(TIMEDIFF(NOW(), lock_time)) <= timeout_seconds;

-- Query to find stale locks
SELECT * FROM distributed_locks WHERE 
    TIME_TO_SEC(TIMEDIFF(NOW(), lock_time)) > timeout_seconds;
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Load**
   - Use connection pooling
   - Index the lock_key column
   - Regular cleanup of expired locks

2. **Lock Contention**
   - Implement backoff strategies
   - Monitor lock acquisition times
   - Consider using read/write locks when appropriate

## Conclusion

Distributed locking is crucial for maintaining data consistency in distributed systems. While MySQL-based implementation is straightforward and reliable for moderate scale applications, consider other solutions like Redis or Zookeeper for high-scale deployments. Always implement proper error handling, monitoring, and maintenance procedures regardless of the chosen solution.
